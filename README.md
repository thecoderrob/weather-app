# LX Take Home Challenge

If you're reading this‚Ä¶ Congratulations üéâ!! It means we see potential in you
and would love to move forward and learn more about your technical side to
better understand if you'd be a good fit for the team.

We've created a small app with a few tasks that will allow you to show us your
technical skill and problem solving skills in a practical setting.

We have purposely left the descriptions without exact design details so that you can
show us your creative skills.

The estimated time to complete both tasks is 4 hours.


## Getting Started üïπÔ∏è

### Frontend
`cd frontend`<br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run start`

### Backend
`cd backend` <br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run start`

<br>

## Task 1: Improve weather app
Approximate time: 2 hours

First of all you're going to have to improve the user experience of the weather app. Although the app
is displaying the weather data correctly, it's seriously lacking in style and usability. This is where
you come in!

### Improve the user experience of the weather app:
 - Weather card should show location name, current temperature and current weather condition (partly cloudy, sunny etc)
 - Add an icon corresponding to the current weather condition to the card (i.e. Cloudy shows a cloud icon).
 - Add the ability to add weather cards by typing a city name in a searchbar.
 - Add ability to delete weather cards.
 - (optional) Add the ability to drag-and-drop weather cards so they can be moved up and down the list.

<br>

## Task 2: Integration
Approximate time: 2 hours

Now we are going to update the backend of the app so that we can retrieve real data!
You are going to add an external api call that will retrieve real weather data.

### Add integration to weather app:
 - Add call to external api of your choice to retrieve weather data per location (openweather has a free api you can use).
 - Add a refresh button to the card, once clicked will retrieve updated weather information.
 - Display the latest update time on the card.
 - (optional) Store the weather information in local-storage so that the API is not called unnecessarily on a page refresh.

## Tips: üí°
 - Feel free to use any tools/packages at your disposal, just like you would in a normal project.
 - The UI is completely up to you! However we do recommend keeping a simple and professional design theme.
 - Make Git commits as you go so that we can see your process.
